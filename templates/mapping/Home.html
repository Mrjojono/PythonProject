            North America, third largest of the world’s continents, lying for the most part between the Arctic Circle
            and the Tropic of Cancer. It extends for more than 5,000 miles (8,000 km) to within 500 miles (800 km) of
            both the North Pole and the Equator and
            has an east-west extent of 5,000 miles. It covers an area of 9,355,000 square miles (24,230,000 square
            km).North America occupies the northern portion of the landmass generally referred to as the New World, the
            Western Hemisphere, or simply
            the Americas. Mainland North America is shaped roughly like a triangle, with its base in the north and its
            apex in the south; associated with the continent is Greenland, the largest island in the world, and such
            offshore groups as the Arctic
            Archipelago, the West Indies, Haida Gwaii (formerly the Queen Charlotte Islands), and the Aleutian Islands.

            South America, fourth largest of the world’s continents. It is the southern portion of the landmass
            generally referred to as the New World, the Western Hemisphere, or simply the Americas. The continent is
            compact and roughly triangular in shape, being
            broad in the north and tapering to a point—Cape Horn, Chile—in the south.South America is bounded by the
            Caribbean Sea to the northwest and north, the Atlantic Ocean to the northeast, east, and southeast, and the
            Pacific Ocean to the west.
            In the northwest it is joined to North America by the Isthmus of Panama, a land bridge narrowing to about 50
            miles (80 km) at one point. Drake Passage, south of Cape Horn, separates South America from Antarctica.

            Europe, second smallest of the world’s continents, composed of the westward-projecting peninsulas of Eurasia
            (the great landmass that it shares with Asia) and occupying nearly one-fifteenth of the world’s total land
            area. It is bordered on the north by
            the Arctic Ocean, on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the south (west to east) by the Mediterranean
            Sea, the Black Sea, the Kuma-Manych Depression, and the Caspian Sea. The continent’s eastern boundary (north
            to south) runs along the
            Ural Mountains and then roughly southwest along the Emba (Zhem) River, terminating at the northern Caspian
            coast.

            Africa, the second largest continent (after Asia), covering about one-fifth of the total land surface of
            Earth. The continent is bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, on the north by the Mediterranean Sea, on
            the east by the Red Sea and the Indian
            Ocean, and on the south by the mingling waters of the Atlantic and Indian oceans.Africa’s total land area is
            approximately 11,724,000 square miles (30,365,000 square km), and the continent measures about 5,000 miles
            (8,000 km) from north to
            south and about 4,600 miles (7,400 km) from east to west. Its northern extremity is Al-Ghīrān Point, near
            Al-Abyaḍ Point (Cape Blanc), Tunisia; its southern extremity is Cape Agulhas, South Africa; its farthest
            point east is Xaafuun (Hafun)
            Point, near Cape Gwardafuy (Guardafui), Somalia; and its western extremity is Almadi Point (Pointe des
            Almadies), on Cape Verde (Cap Vert), Senegal. In the northeast, Africa was joined to Asia by the Sinai
            Peninsula until the construction
            of the Suez Canal. Paradoxically, the coastline of Africa—18,950 miles (30,500 km) in length—is shorter than
            that of Europe, because there are few inlets and few large bays or gulfs.

            Asia, the world’s largest and most diverse continent. It occupies the eastern four-fifths of the giant
            Eurasian landmass. Asia is more a geographic term than a homogeneous continent, and the use of the term to
            describe such a vast area always carries
            the potential of obscuring the enormous diversity among the regions it encompasses. Asia has both the
            highest and the lowest points on the surface of Earth, has the longest coastline of any continent, is
            subject overall to the world’s widest
            climatic extremes, and, consequently, produces the most varied forms of vegetation and animal life on Earth.
            In addition, the peoples of Asia have established the broadest variety of human adaptation found on any of
            the continents.

            At about 3 million square miles (7.7 million square km), Australia is the smallest continent on Earth. In
            fact, it’s closer in size to Greenland than it is to South America. Does that make Australia an island like
            Greenland? Although Australia is sometimes
            called an “island continent,” most geographers consider islands and continents to be separate things.
            According to Britannica, an island is a mass of land that is both “entirely surrounded by water” and also
            “smaller than a continent.” By
            that definition, Australia can’t be an island because it’s already a continent.
